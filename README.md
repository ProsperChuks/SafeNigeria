# Problem

Emergency never comes with prior notification. In Nigeria detecting emergencies and reporting them is a real challenge. With a lot of fake news on the internet, Accidents and Crimes that happen in Nigeria Neighborhoods are mostly faced with problem of quick response due to lag in reporting time

# Proposed Solution

This software is one, that allows people to record emergencies that happen around them and post them online, for people to stay safe off there or take measures. It would curb the gap in reporting emergencies and also curb fake news online, since people now can tell their news, and comments on each posts would affirm the veracity of the news

# Proposed Stack

Javascript, Django, PostgreSQL, Heroku and AWS

# Benefit

- Keeping citizens safe and informed
- Curb the gap in reporting emergencies online
- Democratizing NPF
